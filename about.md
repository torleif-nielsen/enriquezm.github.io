## Who I am.
How's it going? My name is Myles Enriquez. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV and I'm a Front End Developer.

I received my BA in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in December of 2015. I'm a recent graduate who is looking for new opportunities and experiences to add to my belt.

## What I'm doing.

I currently am a self-taught Front End Developer who is learning through countless videos, books, and conversation. I did learn a couple things in school, but the focus was more on lower level programming. Yes, it was interesting but it never grasps me the way web development did.

I enjoy the visual designing part of web development. Even though I know computer science topics such as algorithms, theories, and data structures, I want to focus more on building the Front End of an app or website. So, for the past 2 years I've gradually been trying to get involved with Front End Web Design and Development.

I know it's a growing field and competition will be high, but I won't stop. Anything worth doing, is not easy.

## Where I find inspiration.

I try to find most of my inspiration anywhere I can. Whether it's at an art gallery, concert, magazine, I try to find anything that's just different. I love minimalism and the idea of just having enough to get the job done (I don't see the need to add all the 'fluff').

I always try new things and talk to different people, because I know that going out there and experiencing new things will bring new ideas to the design/development table.

I enjoy the unusual and appreciate change in things. The world of web is a fast-paced, ever changing world, and change is good!

## Aside from the screen.

Now yes I love Front End Development/Design, but we're all human right? We have our hobbies and talents. When I'm not learning, developing, or designing on the screen, I'm most likely drinking a good cup of coffee...Not even kidding!

I love coffee and recently have gotten into manual brewing. Specifically, pour overs are my thing now. So if you love coffee too, why not have a good conversation over coffee!? (Seriously let me know, I'm down).

Besides the coffee, I enjoy listening to music. Tons and tons of music. I've actually thought of making a whole new blog just for music but that'll be a future project. I specifically listen to a lot of Flume-ish, atmospheric-like, weird-sounding music. Usually stuff you don't hear anywhere on the radio. Check out my [soundcloud playlist](https://soundcloud.com/my_en/sets/wired_inn) if you like!

And aside from all that I also rock climb, watch weird documentaries, and listen to [Comedy Bang Bang podcast](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/).

## All jokes aside.

I'm a friendly guy trying to experience life and not just exist in it, you know? If you ever have any questions go ahead and email me via [here](mailTo:enri.myles@gmail.com) and let me know.
