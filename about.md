## Who am I?

My name is Myles Enriquez and I'm a Web Developer.

I found my passion through college where I received my **BA in Computer Science**. While in college I started by learning languages such as Java and C but it wasn't until I got involved with web scripting that I fell in love with web development.

From there I got more involved with how people interacted with sites and found my passion for **User Experience Design**. I was infatuated with the fact that psychology is involved with how people interact with web/mobile apps. I never took classes such as Human Computer Interaction, but have found that I truly love this field.

Most of what I know in the field of User Experience has been self-taught. Through countless hours of reading, videos, and tests done by myself, I have developed skills and methods for handling an app's experience. I would say I'm at a beginner/intermediate level, but one thing for sure is that put effort and craft into every project I get myself involved with.

With every project I do, I aim to get better and better and eventually become a **User Experience Designer**.

## Aside from the techie stuff...

I love the outdoors, chatting with good people, and experiencing new experiences! I'm very open minded and love to learn something new everyday.
