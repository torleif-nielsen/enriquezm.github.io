# Hello There!

My name is Myles Enriquez. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV.

I received my BA in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in December of 2015. I'm a recent graduate who is looking for new opportunities and experiences to add to my belt.

I currently am a self-taught user experience designer who is learning through countless videos, books, and conversation. I hope to work as a user experience designer, but in the meantime need to work on my craft. User experience design has been something that I feel I am passionate for. I find myself losing time when it comes to working on side projects just because of that fact that I get engulfed and have so much fun going through the process.

When I'm not around a computer, or working on any ux based projects, you can find me trying to find the correct balance to a pour over coffee, rock climbing, or listening to some music.
