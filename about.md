## Who I am.
My name is Myles Enriquez. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV.

I received my BA in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in December of 2015. I'm a recent graduate who is looking for new opportunities and experiences to add to my belt.

## What I'm doing.

I currently am a self-taught user experience designer who is learning through countless videos, books, and conversation. I hope to work as a user experience designer, but in the meantime need to work on my craft. User experience design has been something that I know I am passionate for. I find myself losing time when it comes to working on side projects just because of that fact that I get in the zone and have so much fun going through the process.

I know it's a growing field and competition will be high, but I won't stop. Anything worth doing, is not easy.

## Where I find inspiration.

I try to find most of my inspiration anywhere I can. Whether it's at an art gallery, concert, magazine, I try to find anything that's just different. I love minimalism and the idea of just having enough to get the job done (I don't see the need to add all the 'fluff').

I always try new things and talk to different people, because I know that going out there and experiencing new things will bring new ideas to the design/development table.

## Aside from the screen.

When I'm not around a computer, or working on any UX based projects, you can find me trying to master a delicious cup pour over coffee, rock climbing, or listening to some music.
