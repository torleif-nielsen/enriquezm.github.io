# Hello There!

My name is Myles Enriquez. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. I'm an aspiring ux web developer. Now I know UX Developer might sound confusing but basically it's a combination of a UX Designer who also develops for the web.

I got my BA in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in December of 2015. I'm a recent graduate who is looking for new opportunities and experiences to add to my belt.
