This is the 1st part of a 7 part series. These questions have been randomly picked and generated by a website located [here](). The point of these questions is for self documentation and practice. I thought I'd post it also so others can try them out themselves.

# What is the most motivational speech youâ€™ve seen?

The motivational speech I have seen is one from Eric Thomas. He spoke about how you need to work hard and fight for something if you really want it. I've always followed Eric Thomas because his approach on life are with a "go for it" attitude.

If you want to view the speech, you can view it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vuetQSwFW8).

From this video you get 3 rules to follow in order to be successful in whatever you want to do. I've followed these 3 rules through my journey in the world of web (web design, web development, user experience design).

- You have to heart.
- You have to be willing to sacrifice.
- Your pain is temporary.
