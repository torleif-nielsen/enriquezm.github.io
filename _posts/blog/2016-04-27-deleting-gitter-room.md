# Gitter Room Deletion Process

Before I start, do you have a Gitter account? If you're a developer or are every involved with github I really encourage you to create one now.

Now, as I was trying out Gitter and created a "dummy" room (for testing) I eventually had to delete it. It was no longer needed, and what I came acrosss was awesome. Upon deleting your room, gitter actually disables the actual "Delete" button, and gives you a 5 sec countdown. This might seem unimportant or uninteresting, but I thought it was brilliant. 

There have been so many times that I deleted something because things just happened too quickly. With this countdown, you're given time to think about what you're doing. It also gives a list of things to make sure before you actually press the button. Definitely going to put this on a website or app I work on in the future.

Also, if you ever get a chance, Github's deletion process for deleting a repo is clever also, making you actually type out the repo name before actually deleting it.
