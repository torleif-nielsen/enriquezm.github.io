# Udemy's Effective Dropdown Menu

Today I came across an awesome dropdown menu withing Udemy's website. Through the Udemy interface you can view your courses, but Udemy helps you save time (5 secs, those seconds matter!) by giving you a quickstart menu upon hovering over the tab. This quickstart menu gives you frequently viewed courses.

Small detail, but I thought it was awesome!
