These questions have been randomly picked and generated by a website located [here](http://interview-prep-for.design/). The point of these questions is for self documentation and practice. I thought I'd post it also so others can try them out themselves.

### Question:  What is the most motivational speech you’ve seen?

The most motivational speech I have seen is one from [Eric Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Thomas_%28motivational_speaker%29). He spoke about how you need to work hard and fight for something if you really want it. I've always followed Eric Thomas because his approach on life is with a "go for it" attitude.

From this video you get 3 rules to follow in order to be successful in whatever you want to do. I've followed these 3 rules through my journey in the world of web (web design, web development, user experience design).

- You have to heart.
- You have to be willing to sacrifice.
- Your pain is temporary.

I hope by sticking to this path, I'll one day be the designer that I want to be.
