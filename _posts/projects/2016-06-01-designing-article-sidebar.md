# Summary

I wanted to enhance my article roaming experience by having a sidebar. This sidebar would allow a user to roam headings within the article via the sidebar. This not only allows users to roam the article more easily, but also helps the user see what the article contains.

This article is part 1 of the whole article sidebar project, and specifically talks about the designing part of it only.

## 1. Research

So first thing was first. I needed to see how others were already doing it. First website I went to was [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). I love this site because it always has top notch design work. The main object was to get inspired here. The following 3 shots caught my attention:

#### Design A

Original work by [Mani](https://dribbble.com/shots/1497653-Users-And-Receivable-Payments)

#### Reason for choosing:

Gives the user a little more information as to what was selected. Usually, when a list item is selected it tends to just be bold. I thought this was better because the whole tab is selected. This almost might be bad since it might take up a lot more space than we need it to.

#### Design B

Original work by [Daniela Alves](https://dribbble.com/shots/344377-Jobs-Timeline-WIP-v2)

#### Reason for choosing:

I thought that maybe using a timeline type of list would be different? In this screenshot we can see that the longer the duration, the bigger the gap in the timeline. I was thinking we could use this same principle but instead apply it to paragraphs. The longer a paragraph is for a given heading, the bigger the gap on the side list. This would then give the user an idea of how much, in that section of the article, there is to read.

#### Design C

Original work by [musHo](https://dribbble.com/shots/2583708-Ten-X-List)

#### Reason for choosing:

I liked the simplicity of this design. Also, I've always liked to use circles as a "eye hook" that helps the user detect a certain section within a document. With this type of design we could help the user detect how many headings there are within the article.

## 2. Sketching

Next step was to sketch what I had in mind. I usually do this on paper but designed to try things a little different and work on a whiteboard. At the time this was written, every article page was on a 12 column grid.

The actual content of each article took up ```8 columns```. There was an ```offset``` of ```2 columns```. So what this meant was that I had ```2 columns``` worth of space to fit a sidebar in.

## 3. Lo-fi Wireframe

Next step was the fun part, making the wireframe!
