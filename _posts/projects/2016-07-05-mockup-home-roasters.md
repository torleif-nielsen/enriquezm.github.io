### Summary

I created a mockup of a made up coffee roasting business called: Home Roasters. This project was just for practice and somewhat of a personal challenge. Through the designing process I made some UX design based decisions, which are described below.

### Design decisions

The point of this project was to create something clear and concise. The made up client was a small coffee business that focused on roasting coffee beans.

#### Landing Section

Upon arrival on any site, a user will have questions. The best we can do is predict what those questions are going to be and try to answer them.

They more or less want to know, what the product is called, what it is, how it'll help them, and how much it is. At least, that was my thought process when designing this site. So, the first thing I wanted the user to see was the business name: "Home Roasters". Under the name was a description of what Home Roasters was.

#### Difference Section

After the business name and description were clear, we needed a way to differentiate this business from everyone else. Because coffee (to me) is very much a craft as it is a business, I wanted to show off the personalized care for the product.

The target audience, epic coffee fanatics, want something custom and personalized. They want quality, freshness, the best of the best. They want coffee from people who care about the taste and quality.

So that's why I decided to make the Difference Section, a little more casual and fun. Something to bring more emotion to the subject matter and let the user feel as though they could trust the company.

#### Testimonial Section

Customers coming to view your product need to know how they can benefit from using it. And what better way to show how they can, by having other customers talk about how they benefited from it.

#### Pricing Section

Once customers are interested and know how they will benefit from your product, it's time to seal the deal! Adding the pricing section helps the user buy your product. People also love option (but not too many), so that's why I added 3 types of products to choose from.
