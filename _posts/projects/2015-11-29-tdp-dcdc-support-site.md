# Summary

**Things to note:** This site is no longer maintained by me but by the people I worked with at DCDC now. Now, I just contribute to the project through [GitHub](https://github.com/uhm-coe/assist).

Using Jekyll I was able to get a Support Site running for [TDP/DCDC](http://dcdc.coe.hawaii.edu/). I want to say that this project was a big turning point in my web development career because I never created a full on site prior to this. Most of what I had done at this point were small snippets of code from tutorials and such.

I learned proper HTML and CSS standards. I learned how to use Sass and realized how much time it could save me and other developers when making modifications. I also learned (and fell in love with) automation with Gulp. Jekyll was also something new to me at this point and is now my favorite tool to work with when creating simple static websites.

Most importantly I learned how to work with a team.
