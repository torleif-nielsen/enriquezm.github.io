# Summary

I've designed for the web many times but once for print. Print design is something I never got into but the owners at VE Construction, LLC. came to me to help them create business cards. They just needed something simple and clean.

<hr />

## 1. Researching

As always, my first step is to research what people are already doing. I started with dribbble and then also tried to get some insight from off the web (business cards at restaurants). VE Construction's focus was on concrete and landscaping. I made sure to look at their competitors and analyze what they were doing.

Most of what I noticed was that their business cards gave all the services available, but this crowded the business card and made it look confusing. Some cards I looked at were unclear as to what the business was for. I didn't want this to happen with VE Construction so I went to the fundamentals.

That was to only list the things that were important on the card.

1. Business name.
2. Owner name.
3. Phone number.
4. Email.
5. What the business does.

Here are 3 designs that caught my eye:

#### Design A

## 2. Second Round Research

After letting the designs settle I had an idea of what I wanted to do. I wanted the cards to be basic yet present all the information listed above. I needed to also had an "eye hook". The first thing I wanted to person to notice on the card would be the owner's name then the business name.

## 3. Sketching

After some sketching I created some basic ideas:

Two things I kept in mind here were the order of items that the person would look at and what side the business's name would be on. From my personal experience with eye tracking, you don't want to move the person's eyes around too much in order to prevent strain but you also don't want them to be static or else the design would be too boring.

Also, a person usually puts business cards in their wallet, left-side in first. So, why not put the business name on the right side. That way even when the card is in its slot, you can still see the business name sticking out. Why is this important? It could act as a reminder that they need to call the business.

## 4. First Round Mockup

After some more analyzing, I stuck with the business name on the right side and came up with these designs.

After a review with the client, they agreed that they liked the **third** one in the list. This was mainly because of the business name on the side, so I made sure to keep that in my future mockups.

## 5. Second Round Mockup

After a couple more additions and modifications, I ended up with the following design.

A few additions were the business license numbers, description, and small graphic.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project. I never created business cards before but learned quite a bit. I ended up printing out these cards and they are now being used within the company.

#### What I learned:

1. Creating outlines in your design for print.
2. Colors matter when it comes to print.

#### What I would do differently:

1. Run usability test on last mock up.
