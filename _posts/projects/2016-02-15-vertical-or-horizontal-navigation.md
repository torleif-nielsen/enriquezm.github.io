### Summary

I wanted to test out different types of navigation (horizontal/vertical) on a site.

**Edit: This project was initially supposed to be horizontal and vertical navigation bars, but why limit it to just that?? Instead I extended the research and testing to all types of navigation.**

### Mission

Figure out, with some experiments, what type of navigation users enjoy using the most.

<hr />

### Details

Obviously we all now that navigation on a website is important. We want our users to know where to go and help them get there as quick as possible. We want to make it intuitive and comfortable. So what I plan on doing is running a couple fun usability tests on some friends, family, and strangers just to get a general idea of what people like the most.

#### Plan
1. Research different types of vertiable and horizontal bars used now.
2. Choose designs (at least 4).
3. Give each user a task to do on each design.
4. Record which type of navigation was the best.

I'll be going with a "think-aloud approach" so my judging of what is best and worst will be based on user feedback. This is in no way a professional type of test, it's simply an experiment for myself.

#### Research

For the research I wanted to try all areas of navigation. I wanted to try different variations of Vertical and Horizontal navigation. It's also 2016 so why not also work with designs that are more modern, simplistic, and fun right?

#### Designs

After researching on the web, I found these 4 designs I wanted to work with. Of course, there were plenty more that I wanted to try out but then I would never finish this project.
