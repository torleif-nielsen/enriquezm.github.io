# Summary

The Open Source world is an awesome place to get involved in. Projects here, projects there that are all unique in their own little way. But how does one get their foot in and get involved? You could go on sites like GitHub and browse through there but that takes so much time, and you still may not find the type of project you would want to get involved with.

I was thinking:

> Wouldn't it be cool, if we had a central hub that lists projects that might interest you, and within those projects you get a list of the types of help the project needs?

This would be a great opportunity for programmers/developers/documenters/etc. to get involved and get some real world experience! I certainly would love for a web app/mobile app of this sort to be designed and implemented. I figured I could at least design what it was that I'm thinking about to give you and everyone else a better idea of what I'm talking about.

## What is already out there?

I did some surfing on the web to see if this was something that had already been built. There were a couple sites but the one that seemed almost identical to what I was thinking was [openhub](https://www.openhub.net/).

Openhub had almost everything I was thinking:

1. Popular projects.
2. Most active projects.
3. Organizations filtered by their commit history.
4. Break down of each project/organization.

I then made an account to see what more you could do. After looking around I realized that there were a couple things that openhub could not answer for me:

1. Which projects need my contributions?
2. Are there any specific roles that the organization or project is looking for?
    1. Testing
    2. Bug Reporting
    3. Documentation Writing
    4. Graphics/Design Work
3. Can I list only projects that deal with my role?

Openhub was an awesome site but it was more for showcasing yourself and what you have already contributed to.

Then I ran into [openhatch](https://openhatch.org/).

This was more of what I was thinking, but the site seemed to only get you involved with ```bug fixes``` and ```documentation``` for some projects. It was heading the direction I was thinking, but maybe it just hasn't gotten there yet?

## Worth designing?

I would say that yes. It was still worth trying to design a site for what I was thinking of. Was it worth developing? Maybe not. Unless you had a lot of time and money, the open source hub spot that I'm thinking of may be possible.

## Conclusion

So what could we do to make open source software easier to contribute to?

1. Find a way to show smaller projects. Usually, they're the ones that novice roles can start on.
2. Have a list of roles that each project needs. Surely, there are more roles than the ones I listed above.
3. Show projects that I am only interested in. Don't show me ```shell scripting``` when I want to help ```document```.

If anyone is up for the great task, maybe we can connect and start working on it. Let me know in the comments below!
