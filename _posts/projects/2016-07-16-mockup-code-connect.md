### Summary

I created a mockup of a concept I've had for the past few months. I decided to actually design it. CodeConnect is basically a place to sort of advertise your project. Not in a way to get popular, but in a way to bring in team roles that are needed.

### Details

Basically, every project involves a lot of people. Sure, you can go out your way to do all the jobs that need to be done by yourself, but it's always better to find someone who can do it for you. Someone that enjoys doing it.

That's where **CodeConnect** comes in.

With CodeConnect, you can create a "profile" for you projects. You can list your project's current members, roles needed, live links, github links, etc. Then, when someone wanting to get involved with open source software goes out there looking on CodeConnect for project their interested in, they'll be able to find you!

### Conclusion

This project is still in the beginning stages and still needs a lot of user testing to be done, but I believe it would be something awesome to have!

Once I have enough time, I'll for sure get to developing it.
