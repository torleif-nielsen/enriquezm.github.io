### Summary

I volunteered to redesign the University of Hawaii's Accounting Club (AC) Website. Most of my friends were in the club and I was just about to take my first step into the world of web development. I knew nothing but HTML and some CSS, but I figured the only way to truly learn something was to just do it.

### Mission

Learn how to create a website using Wordpress. Give users of the AC website a better experience when trying to do everyday tasks (check events, membership questions, etc.)

### Details

#### 1. Stakeholder Interview

The focus of the product was to give members of Accounting Club a more convenient way of finding general info (ex. membership, events, opportunities). There was no budget, so therefore this project is a volunteered one and no money in involved.

##### Questions Asked:

- What is the product?
- Who will use it?
- Which customers and users are most important to the business?
- What worries you about this project?
- How will you define success for this project?
- Who do you see as your biggest competitor?
- How to you expect to differentiate this product?

#### 2. Web Analytics

Some identified problem areas on the website were: affordance is not clear in some instances. Too many redirects on one page. Color scheme and theme is not well put together and doesn't seem consistent. After some recordings from Hotjar Analytics, I came up with the following:

- total of 905 users in window
- Desktop users: 88%
- Tablet users: 2%
- Mobile users: 10%

#### 3. Concept Statement 

- **Proposed Product Name:** Accounting Club Website
- **Target Users:** Members, alumni, and professionals involved with Accounting Club
- **Description:** Accounting Club Website used for general information about the club.
- **Problems that will be solved:** Finding events, info on membership, member status

#### 4. Brainstorming

Currently in the works.
