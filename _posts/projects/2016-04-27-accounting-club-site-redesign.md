### Summary

I volunteered to redesign the University of Hawaii's Accounting Club (AC) Website. Most of my friends were in the club and I was just about to take my first step into the world of web development. I knew nothing but HTML and some CSS, but I figured the only way to truly learn something was to just do it.

### Objective

Learn how to create a website using Wordpress. Give users of the AC website a better experience when trying to do everyday tasks (check events, membership questions, etc.)
