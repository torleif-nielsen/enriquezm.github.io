# Summary

While working for Distance Course Design & Consulting in Hawaii, I worked on a few infographics that displayed survey information. I have to be honest and say that it was difficult presenting survey data in a graphical way. It was my first shot at making infographics but I learned a lot from this experience.

The following 4 infographics were designed using a web application called [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/) so there were some limitations, but all in all it turned out pretty well.

## Design Thoughts

Things to note: The previous designer had already set up a template for me to go off. What I used was the **background images** and **color scheme**. Everything else was created by me.

I wanted to create something simple. I figured that people don't have time to stay and look at data and try to figure what the data is even for. Using icons was a good way to associate information with a minimal image. This helps the user save time and prevent frustration.

I also made sure to give percentage values a big font size. The main thing a user would want to view when looking at a survey would be the numbers, therefore it was an important component to the infographic.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot from this project. Most of it had to do with design. I never messed with design because I'm mainly a developer but it was fun and actually refreshing. I learned some topics such as [Gestalt Principles](http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/gestalt-theory-10134960). Some things I would probably change would be to first sketch the infographic. I wasted a lot of time moving things here and there without having a clear idea of what I needed or wanted.

If I were to sketch (maybe on a white board), things would be a lot easier to modify until the design felt ready to move into the actual digital designing phase.
